1] hamming.py

For the hamming weight function, there are both divide and conquer and interative solutions to the problem.

	___To Run the Program___

Run the .py file and enter the integer that you want the hamming weight to be calculated from. Then specify the sequential or divide and conquer method. To do so, spell the method out correctly and then the calculation will commence.




2 & 3] matrixsearch.py

For the matrix search program, I have writen a highly efficent program that determines both the larges value as well as the smallest value in the given array.

	___To Run the Program___

Run the .py file and keep in mind!

> The first array contains two integers N and M, representing the 
	number of rows and columns in the matrix.
> The following N arrays each contain M integers, representing the 
	elements in each row of the matrix




4] matrixmult.py

The matrix multiplication program uses the pseudocode provided in class, and splits the program into multiple other functions in an attempt to keep the program readable and concise. 

	___To Run the Program___

Run the .py file. 
When inputing data, all inputs are to be separated by commas. The matrix multiplication function should work without a hitch.




5] towersofhanoi.py

This program returns the moveset to solve the towers of hanoi algorithmic problem given 'n' (the number of disks)

	___To Run the Program___

Run the .py file. specify the number of disk and click enter!
